# SOCIAL APP

Social App is a simple sample application that mirrors the relationships of twitter.

The application includes minimal front-end styling through the bootstrap framework, as the primary focus was to demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the Rails framework.

The Social App is live and can be visited at: https://protected-tundra-9919.herokuapp.com/
